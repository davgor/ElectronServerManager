## Code Quality Requirements

After **EVERY** code change or file modification in this project:

1. **Run ESLint auto-fix** on modified files:

   ```
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

2. **Run Prettier formatting** on modified files:

   ```
   npm run format
   ```

3. **Verify no linting errors** (must pass):

   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Verify formatting is correct** (must pass):

   ```
   npm run format:check
   ```

5. **Type checking** (recommended before commits):
   ```
   npm run type-check
   ```

## When to Run

- ✅ After creating new files
- ✅ After editing any `.ts` or `.tsx` files
- ✅ After editing configuration files that affect code style
- ✅ Before confirming any task is complete

## Execution Order

Always run in this order:

1. `npm run lint:fix` (fixes linting issues)
2. `npm run format` (applies Prettier formatting)
3. `npm run lint` (verify no errors remain)
4. `npm run format:check` (verify formatting is correct)

## Important Notes

- **Do not skip these steps** - they are mandatory for all code changes
- If lint or format checks fail, fix the issues and re-run until passing
- The goal is zero warnings and 100% code quality compliance
- These rules ensure consistency across the entire codebase

**Remember**: Clean, formatted, and properly linted code is not optional.
