# Steam Server Manager

A vibe coded pile of slop. BUT it was kinda fun to make, and managing my games servers by hand was
a pain in the ass. So here we go.....

This will run and autodetect and game servers that are installed, from there it has a handy dandy
little UI that allows you to start up a server that you have installed, and set a few handy things.
Like Auto reboot on failure, or auto-update, or set establishing backups. Its pretty simple but it
helps me, so if it helps your congrats!
